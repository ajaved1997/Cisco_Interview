My Java Applicaion is called src/GetLogsExtension.java. I have also attached the log file needed for the Java Program called log_file.log as well as the Coding Exercise given to me.


If you wish to execute my program, complete the following steps:
1) Change the directory/location of the log file 
2) Add 3 jar files to your program.
